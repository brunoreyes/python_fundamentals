#A sequence is an ordered set of items
#"Hello World" contains 11 intems, and each item is a character, thus it is an ordered set of items

#A list such as the one below is a sequence type
# A sequence is a list of strings, each item is considered a sequence as well,
# a list is comprised of multiple sequences within a sequence
#since a sequence is ordered, we can use indexes to access individual items in the sequence.
computer_parts = ["pc", "mouse", "monitor"]
computer_parts[1]  # this is the string mouse bc it is index[1]

#recall that you can obtain values from an index of a sequence as well as shown below
print(computer_parts[0][1])  # this should produce the letter c
print(computer_parts[2][-3:-6:-1])  #tin

#this sequence type can be multiplied and concatenated but some sequence types can't be concatenated like ranges
string1 = "he's "
string2 = "probably "
string3 = "pining "
string4 = "for the "
string5 = "fjords "
print(string1 + string2 + string3 + string4 + string5)
print("he's " "probably " "pining " "for the " "fjords ")

#strings can be multiplied, this prints Hello 5 times on the same line
print("Hello " * 5)

print("Hello " * (5 + 4))
print("Hello" * 5 + " 4")

today = "friday"
print("day" in today)  #since day is in today, it prints true
print("fri" in today) #since fri is in today, it prints true
print("thurs" in today) #since thurs isn't in today, it prints false
print("parrot" in "fjord") #since parrot isn't in fjord, it prints false
