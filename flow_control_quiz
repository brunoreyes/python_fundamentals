Question 1:
The following program is intended to print out a "times table" for the value 8.

value = 8
answer = 0
 
for x in range(1, 13):
    answer = value * x
print("{0} times {1} is {2}".format(x, value, answer))


The output should be:

1 times 8 is 8
2 times 8 is 16
3 times 8 is 24
4 times 8 is 32
5 times 8 is 40
6 times 8 is 48
7 times 8 is 56
8 times 8 is 64
9 times 8 is 72
10 times 8 is 80
11 times 8 is 88
12 times 8 is 96


Why don't we get the expected output?
