# Scope is when parameter variables only exist within a function, not outside of one

# Procedures refer to functions that can return a result or perform an action,
# it's generally best practice to avoid creating a function that does both.

#default values are like arg=0 or arg=1 and can allow not having to input anything.

#docstrings explain what the function does, it's action, what it takes in, and it's result
