# Inheritance is like a seagul, crow, eagle, ostrich, and pengiun all having the trait of a beak and wings
# due to being all being birds.

# Monopoly, Halo, and Blackjack share the inheritance of being a game.
# However they are all different in their own right, board game, card game, and video game.

# In both examples above there is a superclass or class (being a bird or being a game)

#  So all our birds inherit some base properties from their base/super class. They also inherit methods,
# so birds can all walk and eat but the invididual bird classes have their own unique properties and methods.
# Penguins can swim, ostriches can run, and seaguls, crows and eagles can fly.

# We can go from the base class "birds" and divide further into sub-classes like "flying" or "flightless"
# "flying" is simultaneously a subclass of birds and a super class (higher class) of seagul, eagle and crow.

# Python allows for multiple inheritance but be weary
