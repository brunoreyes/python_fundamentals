# A database is just an organized collection of data that can be used to store info on a computer
# or accessed from a web server over the internet.

# Technically, anything that stores and recieves information can be called a database or structured data.

# The SQLite database is supported by python, it's completely self-contained and needs no server to run on.
# It was originally designed to be embedded into systems like missile guidance systems.

# SQL lite runs on sequel languages, text messeages on Iphone run on sequel lite

# Select, Insert, Update, Delete

# More extensive sequel work will require learning normalization, the practice of systematically decomposing
# tables to eliminate redundancy(repitition) following the DRY approach. 

# A database is the container for all the data that is stored

# Database Directory: provides a comprehensive list of the structre and tye of data in the database

# Table: a collection of related data held in the database
