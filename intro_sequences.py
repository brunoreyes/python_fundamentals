# a sequence is an ordered collection of items
# the order allows spequences to refer to individual items by their index positions
# sequence types: list, tuple, range
# In Python, anything that you can iterate over is known as an iterable
#   so if you can use it in a for loop, then it's iterable, where index starts at 0
# an __int__ method
# or an __getintem__ method

# all sequences (strings, list, etc) are iterable types but not all iterables are sequences
# you can use a dictionary in a for loop but it is not a sequence
