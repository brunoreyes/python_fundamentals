    <h1>Aggregation</h1>
    <p>
      Unlike <strong>composition</strong>, aggregation uses existing instancesof
      objects to build up another object
    </p>
    <p>
      The composed object doesnt actually own the objects that its composed ofIf
      the aggregated object is destroyed, the objects it was comprised of still
      exist
